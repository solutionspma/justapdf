# JustaPDF  
**It’s just a PDF, damn.**

JustaPDF is a modular, credit-based PDF editor built as a fair alternative to subscription-locked PDF software. Users pay only for real PDF operations—edit, sign, merge, OCR—never to download their own files.

## Why JustaPDF Exists

PDFs are an open standard.  
Editing them isn’t magic.  
Charging $30/month to fix a typo is nonsense.

JustaPDF was built to restore sanity:
- No forced subscriptions
- No dark patterns
- No paywalls on downloads
- No bloated desktop installs

Pay for the work performed. Then move on.

## Core Principles

- **Modular**: Every PDF action is a discrete operation
- **Transparent**: Credits are spent only on successful actions
- **Fair**: Downloads and previews are always free
- **Open-standard aligned**: Built on real PDF object mechanics
- **User-first**: Finish the task and leave—no hostage SaaS

## How Billing Works

PDFs are made of objects (text, images, pages, annotations).

Each meaningful change = one operation = credits.

Examples:
- Edit text → 1 credit  
- Add signature → 1 credit  
- Merge PDFs → 2 credits  
- OCR page → 3 credits  

Failed actions refund automatically.  
Downloads never cost credits.

## Pricing Model

- **Free Tier** – limited credits to try it out
- **Credit Packs** – one-time purchase, never expire
- **Monthly Plans** – recurring credits for frequent users
- **No lock-ins** – subscriptions are optional, not required
